    "# ScholarAI: An Intelligent AI Agent for Personalized Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "ScholarAI is a generative AI-powered learning assistant designed to help students study more effectively using their own materials. Built using LangChain v0.1+, Gemini, and modern GenAI capabilities, ScholarAI enables personalized, grounded, and interactive academic support.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I demonstrate how ScholarAI can:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Summarize research papers into concise study notes\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Answer personalized questions based on user-uploaded content using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This capstone project was developed as part of the 5-Day GenAI Intensive Course by Google and Kaggle, and highlights practical use of few-shot prompting, retrieval-based Q&A, and function calling in a real-world educational scenario.\n",

    "The following GenAI features from the list were successfully implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-shot prompting** – Custom prompt templates were used to guide the summarization and Q&A responses.\n",
    "* **Document understanding** – Academic texts were split, embedded, and processed using LangChain's document tools.\n",
    "* **Embeddings** – Text chunks were converted into embeddings using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings`.\n",
    "* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – The core system retrieves relevant documents before generating answers.\n",
    "* **Vector search/vector store/vector database** – Used `InMemoryVectorStore` for similarity-based retrieval of academic content."

       "'Title: A Multi-Object Rectified Attention Network for Scene Text Recognition\\nSummary: Irregular text is widely used. However, it is considerably difficult to\\nrecognize because of its various shapes and distorted patterns. In this paper,\\nwe thus propose a multi-object rectified attention network (MORAN) for general\\nscene text recognition. The MORAN consists of a multi-object rectification\\nnetwork and an attention-based sequence recognition network. The multi-object\\nrectification network is designed for rectifying images that contain irregular\\ntext. It decreases the difficulty of recognition and enables the\\nattention-based sequence recognition network to more easily read irregular\\ntext. It is trained in a weak supervision way, thus requiring only images and\\ncorresponding text labels. The attention-based sequence recognition network\\nfocuses on target characters and sequentially outputs the predictions.\\nMoreover, to improve the sensitivity of the attention-based sequence\\nrecognition network, a fractional pickup method is proposed for an\\nattention-based decoder in the training phase. With the rectification\\nmechanism, the MORAN can read both regular and irregular scene text. Extensive\\nexperiments on various benchmarks are conducted, which show that the MORAN\\nachieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available.\\n\\nTitle: Grounding Human-to-Vehicle Advice for Self-driving Vehicles\\nSummary: Recent success suggests that deep neural control networks are likely to be a\\nkey component of self-driving vehicles. These networks are trained on large\\ndatasets to imitate human actions, but they lack semantic understanding of\\nimage contents. This makes them brittle and potentially unsafe in situations\\nthat do not match training data. Here, we propose to address this issue by\\naugmenting training data with natural language advice from a human. Advice\\nincludes guidance about what to do and where to attend. We present the first\\nstep toward advice giving, where we train an end-to-end vehicle controller that\\naccepts advice. The controller adapts the way it attends to the scene (visual\\nattention) and the control (steering and speed). Attention mechanisms tie\\ncontroller behavior to salient objects in the advice. We evaluate our model on\\na novel advisable driving dataset with manually annotated human-to-vehicle\\nadvice called Honda Research Institute-Advice Dataset (HAD). We show that\\ntaking advice improves the performance of the end-to-end network, while the\\nnetwork cues on a variety of visual features that are provided by advice. The\\ndataset is available at https://usa.honda-ri.com/HAD.'"

      "**A Multi-Object Rectified Attention Network for Scene Text Recognition:** This paper introduces a Multi-Object Rectified Attention Network (MORAN) designed to improve scene text recognition, particularly for irregular text. MORAN combines a multi-object rectification network, which corrects distorted text images to ease recognition, with an attention-based sequence recognition network that focuses on relevant characters for prediction. The rectification network is trained with weak supervision, requiring only images and text labels. A fractional pickup method is also introduced to enhance the sensitivity of the attention-based decoder during training. Experimental results demonstrate that MORAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on both regular and irregular scene text recognition benchmarks.\n",

The proposed approach trains an end-to-end vehicle controller that integrates advice, adapting its visual attention and control (steering and speed) based on the guidance provided. Attention mechanisms link controller behavior to salient objects mentioned in the advice. The model is evaluated on the Honda Research Institute-Advice Dataset (HAD), a novel dataset with human-to-vehicle advice. Results show that incorporating advice improves the performance of the end-to-end network, enabling it to focus on visual features indicated by the advice.\n"
