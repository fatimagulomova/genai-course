Features Used in ScholarAI Project\n","The following GenAI features from the list were successfully implemented:\n","\n","* **Few-shot prompting** – Custom prompt templates were used to guide the summarization and Q&A responses.\n","* **Document understanding** – Academic texts were split, embedded, and processed using LangChain's document tools.\n","* **Embeddings** – Text chunks were converted into embeddings using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings`.\n","* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – The core system retrieves relevant documents before generating answers.\n","* **Vector search/vector store/vector database** – Used `InMemoryVectorStore` for similarity-based retrieval of academic

A Multi-Object Rectified Attention Network for Scene Text Recognition\\nSummary: Irregular text is widely used. However, it is considerably difficult to\\nrecognize because of its various shapes and distorted patterns. In this paper,\\nwe thus propose a multi-object rectified attention network (MORAN) for general\\nscene text recognition. The MORAN consists of a multi-object rectification\\nnetwork and an attention-based sequence recognition network. The multi-object\\nrectification network is designed for rectifying images that contain irregular\\ntext. It decreases the difficulty of recognition and enables the\\nattention-based sequence recognition network to more easily read irregular\\ntext. It is trained in a weak supervision way, thus requiring only images and\\ncorresponding text labels. The attention-based sequence recognition network\\nfocuses on target characters and sequentially outputs the predictions.\\nMoreover, to improve the sensitivity of the attention-based sequence\\nrecognition network, a fractional pickup method is proposed for an\\nattention-based decoder in the training phase. With the rectification\\nmechanism, the MORAN can read both regular and irregular scene text.
