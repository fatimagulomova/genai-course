# 🌟 My Experience with the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive (Google x Kaggle)

Welcome to my repository documenting my experience with the **5-Day Generative AI Intensive**, a hands-on online course organized by **Google** and **Kaggle** (March 31 – April 4). This repository contains my learning notes, daily assignments, and my capstone project titled **ScholarAI** — a generative AI-powered academic assistant.

## 📘 About the Course

### 🧠 What is the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive?

This intensive course was designed to help developers like me **dive deep into the technologies behind Generative AI**. Created by Google’s ML researchers and engineers, it includes both **conceptual breakdowns** and **hands-on notebooks** to help learners build real Gen AI projects with confidence.

### 🛠️ How It Works

Each day of the course included:
- 📚 **Daily Assignments**: Whitepapers, AI Studio codelabs, and a podcast generated with NotebookLM.
- 💬 **Discord Threads**: Real-time discussions with fellow learners and experts.
- 🎥 **YouTube Live Seminars & AMAs**: Daily deep-dives and Q&A sessions with Google experts.
- 🎯 **Capstone Project**: Optional project to apply what we learned — showcased below!

## 💡 My Reflections

- This course helped me transition from using LLMs as a user to **thinking like a builder**.
- I realized how **important prompt engineering** and **embedding strategies** are in real-world applications.
- I learned how Gen AI agents are constructed and how **MLOps differs** when deploying generative systems.
- Most importantly, I walked away with a working capstone project and clearer direction for future AI work.
