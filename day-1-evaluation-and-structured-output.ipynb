    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "**Key Aspects of the Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Model Architecture:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.\n",
       "    *   It builds upon the research advances of Gemini 1.0 and a longer history of MoE research at Google.\n",
       "    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows for a larger total parameter count while keeping the number of activated parameters constant.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "    *   Trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators.\n",
       "    *   The training is distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Training Data:**\n",
       "    *   A variety of multimodal and multilingual data is used.\n",
       "    *   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from various domains, including web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Instruction Tuning:**\n",
       "    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "    *   Further tuning is based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Long-Context Understanding:**\n",
       "    *   The model incorporates significant architecture changes to enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Safety Mitigations:**\n",
       "    *   Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) are used to mitigate safety risks.\n",
       "    *   The safety mitigation is focused on adversarial or \"harm-inducing\" queries.\n",
       "    *   New image-to-text SFT data is incorporated, as safety SFT data for text-only queries was not as effective for harm-inducing image-to-text queries.\n",
       "\n",

       "Imagine you have a puppy, and you want to teach it to understand and follow your instructions.\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Lots and Lots of Examples:** First, you show the puppy many, many examples of things you want it to learn. For example, you show it pictures of cats and say \"cat,\" pictures of dogs and say \"dog,\" and so on. You also read it lots of stories and talk to it all the time. The puppy is like the computer model, and all the pictures, stories, and conversations are the training data.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Learning the Patterns:** The puppy starts to notice patterns. It sees that cats have pointy ears and whiskers, and dogs have floppy ears and wagging tails. It also learns that certain words go together, like \"good\" and \"boy.\" The computer model does the same thing. It looks for patterns in the training data and learns how words, images, and sounds are related.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Making Predictions:** Now, you show the puppy a new picture, and you ask, \"What's this?\" The puppy tries to guess based on what it has learned. If it says \"cat\" when it sees a cat, that's good! If it says \"dog,\" you gently correct it. The computer model also makes predictions. It might try to guess the next word in a sentence or answer a question about a picture.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Getting Better and Better:** Every time the puppy makes a mistake, you help it learn from that mistake. You give it feedback so it can do better next time. The computer model also gets feedback. It adjusts its internal settings to make better predictions in the future. This process is repeated over and over again, with more and more examples, until the puppy (or the computer model) becomes very good at understanding and following instructions.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, in short, training a large language model is like teaching a puppy: you show it lots of examples, it learns the patterns, it makes predictions, and it gets better and better with feedback. The more examples you give it, the smarter it becomes!\n",

    "## Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
